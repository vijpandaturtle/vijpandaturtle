- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects involving Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP.
- 🌱 **What I've built so far** .. apps using Deep Learning that
    * Detect stress using EEG signals from a BCI Headset (LSTM, PyTorch)
    * Detect falls from video feed (MobileNetv2, PyTorch)
    * Detect violent activity from CCTV video feed (Hummingbird, Scikit-learn)
    * Recognize emotion from speech (PySpark, PyTorch)
    * Teach a self-driving car to drive in a simulator (CARLA, Tensorflow)
