### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm vij. I'm an Engineer by profession.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects involving Machine Learning in the Classical and Quantum Computing Domain
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Systems Thinking. I believe different types of tech are really pieces of a large puzzle. In order to really solve a problem, you need to figure out how to put them together. 
- ðŸ˜„ My Interests: R&D - Building intelligent software and hardware systems. (Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Robotics, Brain Computer Interfaces) And anything else that makes me curious ! I have also done graduate level coursework in public policy, with a specialization in tech and policy. You can find some of my related work [here](https://oneeclectic.substack.com/). 
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K_ST0dMAAAAJ&hl=en), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/vijpandaturtle), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayasriiyer), [Medium](https://vijayasriiyer.medium.com/). Check out my newsletter on substack [here](https://oneeclectic.substack.com/).
