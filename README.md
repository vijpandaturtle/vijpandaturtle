### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm vij. I'm an Engineer by profession.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects involving AI in the Classical and Quantum Computing Domain
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Systems Thinking. I believe different types of tech are really pieces of a large puzzle. In order to really solve a problem, you need to figure out how to put them together. 
- ðŸ˜„ My Interests: R&D - Building intelligent software and hardware systems. And anything else that makes me curious :)
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/vijpandaturtle) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayasriiyer) as well.
