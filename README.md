### Hi there 👋

I'm vij. I'm an Engineer, Grad Student@[Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/coimbatore/) and Learnaholic. Visit my website [here.](https://vijpandaturtle.github.io/) 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects involving Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP.
- 🌱 **What I've built so far** .. apps using Deep Learning that
    * Detect stress using EEG signals from a BCI Headset (LSTM, PyTorch)
    * Detect falls from video feed (MobileNetv2, PyTorch)
    * Detect violent activity from CCTV video feed (Hummingbird, Scikit-learn)
    * Recognize emotion from speech (PySpark, PyTorch)
    * Teach a self-driving car to drive in a simulator (CARLA, Tensorflow) 
- 😄 My Interests: R&D (Computer Vision, Autonomous Driving, Multi-task Learning) and Building ML/AI powered products. I have also done graduate level coursework in public policy, with a specialization in tech and policy. <!--You can find some of my related work [here](https://thenotsodistantfuture.substack.com/).-->
