### Hi there 👋

I'm vij. I'm an Engineer by profession.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects involving AI in the Classical and Quantum Computing Domain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Systems Thinking. I like to see all technology as pieces of a large puzzle. In order to really solve a problem they all need to fit together. 
- 😄 My Interests: R&D - Building intelligent software and hardware systems. And everything else that makes me curious :)
- 💬 You can find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/vijpandaturtle) as well.
