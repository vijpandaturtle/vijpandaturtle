# Projects & Experiments

## 2022

### Stress Detection with BCI
- **Category :** Deep Learning, Signal Processing
- **Description :** Built an end-to-end application to detect signals of stress from brain waves transmitted via an OpenBCI Ganglion 4-channel EEG headset and streamed to AWS Kinesis.Trained and deployed a PyTorch time-series model locally and as an AWS Sagemaker endpoint for scalability. Integrated the Spotify Web API with a front-end in Streamlit for mood based music recommendations.
- **Tools Used :** Brainflow, Streamlit, PyTorch, AWS (IoT Core, Sagemaker, Kinesis, DynamoDB, Lambda), Spotipy
